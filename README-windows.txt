Running livemix on Windows

You can run livemix in two ways:
1) as "livemix.exe", which is simple and doesn't require perl
2) as "perl livemix.pl", which is faster to run, but requires perl installed on your system

For your convenience windows package of Livemix includes binary copies
of SoX and LAME executables.
